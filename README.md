This is version 3.0 of MKNetworkKit. 
Version 3 is a complete rewrite loosely based on version 2 that was released in October 2015.

Version 1.x of MKNetworkKit is deprecated as NSURLConnection is deprecated in iOS 9 and is not available on tvOS.

###Why MKNetworkKit?

* Single network queue for the whole app
* Auto queue sizing and auto network indicator support
* High performance background caching (based on HTTP 1.1 caching specs) built in
* You don't need a separate image cache library
* Background image decompression
* Background completion
* cURL-able debug lines

These are just a few of most interesting features on MKNetworkKit.
