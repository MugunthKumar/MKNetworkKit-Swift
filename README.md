This is version 3.0 of MKNetworkKit. 
Version 3 is a complete rewrite loosely based on [version 2](https://github.com/MugunthKumar/MKNetworkKit) that was released in October 2015.

###Why MKNetworkKit?
Actually, you don't need a networking framework today (post iOS 7). We live in the era of `NSURLSession` and with networking becoming a core feature of every app, you need to know how to write a good networking stack without using a third party library.

Now, you may ask, So, why are there so many networking frameworks? Almost every iOS developer I know uses one or the other networking library.

Well, that's because, when iOS was introduced, the two frameworks built into the iPhone (iOS) SDK, namely, `CFNetwork.framework` and `NSURLConnection`(`Foundation.framework`) were complicated to understand and use.
Though `NSURLConnection` was easier than `CFNetwork` it still wasn't easy enough for most developers.

With iOS 7, Apple introduced `NSURLSession` based networking that blew everything out of water.

Using `NSURLSession` is super easy to use. Most of today's third party networking frameworks that exist today are built on top of `NSURLSession`. With deprecation of `NSURLConnection` in iOS 9 (tvOS 9.0 marks NSURLConnection as unavailable), you don't even need to know the "basics" like `NSURLConnection`. In fact, `NSURLSession` is the new "basics". `NSURLSession` *is* the class that you should learn, if you are doing networking today.

In my opinion, the only benefits of using a networking framework instead of `NSURLSession` are 
1. Easier Authentication (`www-authenticate`based and client certificate/server trust based)
	Authentication with NSURLSession still requires delegate handling like NSURLConnection
2. Multi-part form upload

In addition to the above, MKNetworkKit has the following features.
* Queued Requests (Batch a bunch of requests and get notified once they are done)
* High performance background *caching* (based on HTTP 1.1 caching specs) built in
	* You don't need a separate image cache library
* Fetching remote images are done using extension methods in strings. Just call the `loadRemoteImage` method on any URL String and get the image in the completion handler.
* Auto network indicator support MKNetworkKit manages the display of status bar network indicator for you. (on iOS only)
* cURL-able debug lines
* Fully compatible with application extensions
* Background image decompression
* Background completion
* Full support for NSStreams

###Installation
#### Manual
1. Add this repository as a submodule in your project.
2. Drag the `Core` directory into your  project. 
3. Link your project against `SystemConfiguration.framework` if you haven't already

#### Carthage
To integrate MKNetworkKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:
```
github "MugunthKumar/MKNetworkKit-Swift" "master"
```
Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `MKNetworkKit.framework` into your Xcode project.

We will release a stable tagged version soon.
